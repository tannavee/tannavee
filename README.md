I am a cancer researcher and have over 5 years of academic and industry experience. Currently, I am a Biostatistics graduate student at [UC San Diego](https://ph.ucsd.edu/biostat/current-students/student-profiles/index.html#Master's-Students:~:text=about%20custom%20keyboards.-,Tannavee%20Kumar,-Degree%20Program%3A%20MS) with a continued interest to expand computational tooling and statistical methodology to deliver personalized therapeutic care to patients. Prior to my graduate career, I collaborated with a diverse group of clinicians, computational biologists, and data scientists at a oncology based precision health company. Advancing research aims in partnership with many top 20 pharmaceutical companies, has given me the hands-ons expertise to understand the nuanced nature of sequencing and EHR (electronic health record) data while navigating the multiplex ecosystem of translational and clinical research. 

The Genetics / Genomics and Computer Science background from my undergraduate studies at UC Davis has afforded me the applicable lens to scale pertinent computational tools. Positioned at the intersection of molecular biology, computer science, and statistics, my overarching interests in precision medicine are in conjuction with stretching real world biomedical data usibility with mathematical methods, devloping predictive models to better understand drug response, and applying a genetics lens to interpret results in a biological context. I hope to bring a multidisciplinary approach to my research, and extend ancillary interests in the areas of scientific communication, women's health, medical accessibility, and diverse representation in patient data.
