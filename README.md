I am a Biostatistics graduate student at [The Univeristy of California, San Diego]([https://www.ucdavis.edu/](https://ph.ucsd.edu/biostat/current-students/student-profiles/index.html#Master's-Students:~:text=about%20custom%20keyboards.-,Tannavee%20Kumar,-Degree%20Program%3A%20MS)), 

I am a recent graduate of [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), where I studied Genetics/Genomics and Computer Science. I am particularily interested in the application of machine learning in the area of genetics. I am also passionate about making computer science a more approachable area for people of all backgrounds to learn as any domain can work hand-in-hand with it.
