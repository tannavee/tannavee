I am a recent graduate of [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), where I studied Geneticcs/Genomics and Computer Science. I am particularily interested in the application of machine learning in the area of genetics. I am also passionate about making computer science a more approachable area for people of all backgrounds to learn as any domain can work hand-in-hand with it.
